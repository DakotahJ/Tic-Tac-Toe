# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe GUI in Java using Minimax Algorithm. 
Project includes a Tic-Tac-Toe class that functions as a standalone abstraction that can be plugged into another program, whether text-based or with graphics.
The AI class offers multiple methods to calculate a computer players best move, ranging from random play to an unbeatable minimax algorithm. 
The GUI allows for mouse driven play. Users can freely switch between human vs human or human vs computer. There is a difficulty slider to provide different levels of computer difficulty, and a bonus mode called "Everyone is a Winner," where the goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is subverted. The player wins by forcing a draw. 
Although the GUI doesn't allow the user to switch between X / O or who goes first, the Tic-Tac-Toe and AI class are compatible with those changes. 

This project was inspired and, GUI aside, guided by Robert Heaton's Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners. Great blog, give it a look.
